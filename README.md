# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Business Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. The model identifies customers likely to cancel their service, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Project Requirements

- **Predictive Accuracy**: High accuracy in predicting customer churn
- **Scalability**: Handles large volumes of customer data
- **Integration**: Easy integration with Python-based CRM systems
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for real-time predictions

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv churn_env

# Activate virtual environment
source churn_env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
churn_env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Model

```bash
python churn_prediction_complete.py
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Handled by dropping rows with missing data
- **Categorical Encoding**: Label encoding for categorical variables
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler for numerical features
- **Feature Selection**: Removed CustomerID (not predictive)

### Model Selection
The implementation compares three models:
1. **Logistic Regression**: Linear model, interpretable
2. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method, handles non-linear relationships
3. **Gradient Boosting**: Advanced ensemble, often best performance

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness
- **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Model discrimination ability
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed performance breakdown

## Model Deployment

### 1. Production Integration

```python
import joblib
from churn_prediction_complete import ChurnPredictionModel

# Load the trained model
churn_model = ChurnPredictionModel()
churn_model.load_model('churn_model.joblib')

# Make predictions
customer_data = {
    'Tenure': 5,
    'MonthlyCharges': 70.0,
    'TotalCharges': 350.0,
    'Contract': 'Month-to-month',
    'PaymentMethod': 'Electronic check'
}

prediction = churn_model.predict(customer_data)
print(f"Churn probability: {prediction['churn_probability']:.3f}")
```

### 2. API Integration Example

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load model
model_components = joblib.load('churn_model.joblib')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict_churn():
    customer_data = request.json
    # Apply preprocessing and make prediction
    # Return JSON response
    return jsonify({'churn_probability': 0.25})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### 3. CRM Integration

The model can be integrated into existing CRM systems by:
- Loading the saved model file
- Implementing the prediction function
- Creating automated alerts for high-risk customers
- Triggering retention campaigns

## Performance Optimization

### For Large Datasets
- Use batch processing for predictions
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider model compression techniques

### For Real-time Predictions
- Pre-compute feature transformations
- Use model serving frameworks (TensorFlow Serving, MLflow)
- Implement request queuing for high traffic

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Model Monitoring
- Track prediction accuracy over time
- Monitor feature drift
- Set up alerts for performance degradation

### Regular Updates
- Retrain model with new data (monthly/quarterly)
- Update feature engineering as business evolves
- Validate model assumptions

## Business Impact

### Expected Outcomes
- **Reduced Churn Rate**: 10-20% reduction in customer churn
- **Increased Revenue**: Higher customer lifetime value
- **Improved Efficiency**: Targeted retention efforts
- **Better Customer Experience**: Proactive service improvements

### Key Success Metrics
- Churn prediction accuracy > 80%
- False positive rate < 15%
- Model response time < 100ms
- Integration success rate > 95%

## Technical Specifications

### Model Performance
- **Training Time**: < 5 minutes
- **Prediction Time**: < 10ms per customer
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB
